    - Refresh:    
        `🥑 /refresh`       
    - Show current variables:

    A guac session progresses through a series of stages, each of equal length. Each stage adjusts the emoji input prompt. Once the stages have passed, it is time to refresh. Stage 1: `🥑`, Stage 2: `🥑🔪` Stage 3: `🥑🥣` Stage:4 `🥑🥣🧂`, `Stage 5: 🥘 TIME TO REFRESH`. At stage 5, the user is reminded to refresh with the /refresh macro. This will evaluate the session so farand suggest and implement new functions or automations that will aid in future sessions, with the ultimate approval of the user.


- ## `/help`: Show help for commands, NPCs, or Jinxs. 
      ```bash
      /help 
      ```
      ```
      npc help
      ```
- ## `/init` - Initialize NPC project    
    -set up bare bones infra for an npc team
    ```bash
    # npcsh 
    /init
    ```
    ```bash
    # bash 
    npc init
    ```


- ## `/jinxs` : show available jinxs for team
    Jinxs are Jinja execution templates that let users develop small programs that can build on each other and reference each other through jinja templating. Jinx methods allow us to give smaller LLMs the scaffolding to perform `tool calling`, so to speak, reliably
    ```bash
    # npcsh 
    /jinxs
    # bash 
    npc jinxs
    ```

    ```python
    Available Jinxs:     
    --- Jinxs for NPC: sibiji ---                                                                                                                                                                                                           

    • /bash_executor: Execute bash queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                

    • /calc: A jinx to simplify and evaluate mathematical expressions   (/calc 1+5, /calc 47233*234234)                                                                                                                

    • /data_pull: Execute queries on the ~/npcsh_history.db to pull data. The database contains only information about conversations and other user-provided data. It does not store any information about individual files (/data_pull 'select * from conversation_history limit 10')


    • /file_editor: Examines a file, determines what changes are needed, and applies those changes. (/file_editor filename.py 'instructions for carrying out the editing')                                                                                                                                   

    • /image_generation_jinx: Generates images based on a text prompt. (/image_generation_jinx 'prompt for llm' output_name )                                                                                                                                       

    • /internet_search: Searches the web for information based on a query in order to verify timiely details (e.g. current events) or to corroborate information in uncertain situations. Should be mainly only used when users            
      specifically request a search, otherwise an LLMs basic knowledge should be sufficient. ( /internet_search 'cost of cubs tickets' )
    • /local_search: Searches files in current and downstream directories to find items related to the users query using fuzzy matching. (/local_search 'class NPC')
    Returns only relevant snippets (10 lines around matches) to avoid including too much irrelevant content. Intended for fuzzy searches, not for understanding file sizes.                                                                                                                                                                          

    • /python_executor: Execute scripts with python. Set the ultimate result as the "output" variable. It must be a string. Do not add unnecessary print statements. (/python_executor 'import numpy as np; print(np.arange(1000))')
    • /screen_capture_analysis_jinx: Captures the whole screen and sends the image for analysis  (mostly redundant with /ots.)  
    ```

        Based on the knowledge base results, I can see you're asking about Marcus Aurelius, but the search returned information about Virgil's "Aeneid" instead. Let me connect these for you:                                                     
        Marcus Aurelius was a Roman emperor (161-180 AD) and Stoic philosopher, while the "Aeneid" is Virgil's epic poem about the founding of Rome. Though from different eras, they're both central figures in Roman intellectual history.       
        The "Aeneid" (as detailed in the search results) explores themes of duty, fate, and leadership - concepts that Marcus Aurelius would later grapple with in his philosophical work "Meditations." Both works reflect Roman values of pietas 
        (duty/piety) that were central to Roman identity.                                                                                                                                                                                          
        Would you like me to:                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

        • Search more specifically for Marcus Aurelius in the knowledge base?                                                                                                                                                                     

        • Explain the connection between Stoic philosophy (which Marcus Aurelius practiced) and the values expressed in the Aeneid?                                                                                                               

        • Provide information about Marcus Aurelius based on general knowledge?                                                                                                                                                                   
        The search seems to have focused on Roman literature rather than the specific philosopher-emperor you asked about.

- ## `/wander`: daydreaming for LLMs

  <p align="center"><a href ="https://github.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/blob/main/docs/wander.md">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/main/npcsh/npc_team/kadiefa.png" alt="logo for wander", width=250></a>
  </p>
  A system for thinking outside of the box. From our testing, it appears gpt-4o-mini and gpt-series models in general appear to wander the most through various languages and ideas with high temperatures. Gemini models and many llama ones appear more stable despite high temps. Thinking models in general appear to be worse at this task.

  - Wander with an auto-generated environment  
    ```
    npc --model "gemini-2.0-flash"  --provider "gemini"  wander "how does the bar of a galaxy influence the the surrounding IGM?" \
      n-high-temp-streams=10 \
      high-temp=1.95 \
      low-temp=0.4 \
      sample-rate=0.5 \
      interruption-likelihood=1
    ```
  - Specify a custom environment
    ```
    npc --model "gpt-4o-mini"  --provider "openai"  wander "how does the goos-hanchen effect impact neutron scattering?" \
      environment='a ships library in the south.' \
      num-events=3 \
      n-high-temp-streams=10 \
      high-temp=1.95 \
      low-temp=0.4 \
      sample-rate=0.5 \
      interruption-likelihood=1
    ```
  - Control event generation
    ```
    npc wander "what is the goos hanchen effect and does it affect water refraction?" \
    --provider "ollama" \
    --model "deepseek-r1:32b" \
    environment="a vast, dark ocean ." \
    interruption-likelihood=.1
    ```

- ## `/yap`: an agentic voice control loop

<p align="center"><a href ="https://github.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/blob/main/docs/yap.md"> 
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npc-worldwide/npcsh/main/npcsh/npc_team/yap.png" alt="logo for yap ", width=250></a>
</p>

- an agentic voice control loop with a specified agent. When launching `yap`, the user enters the typical `npcsh` agentic loop except that the system is waiting for either text or audio input.
- voice chat:     
    ```bash
    # npcsh
    /yap
    ```
    ```bash
    # bash
    yap
    npc yap
    ```




## Compilation and NPC Interaction
Compile a specified NPC profile. This will make it available for use in npcsh interactions.
```npcsh
npcsh> /compile <npc_file>
```
You can also use `/com` as an alias for `/compile`. If no NPC file is specified, all NPCs in the npc_team directory will be compiled.

Begin a conversations with a specified NPC by referencing their name
```npcsh
npcsh> /<npc_name>:
```

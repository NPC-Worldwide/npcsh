/alicanto "Building on Agostino et al. (2025) demonstration that semantic Bell inequality violations occur in LLM interpretation with CHSH values reaching 2.3-2.4, and given recent advances in quantum natural language processing using parameterized quantum circuits for word embeddings (Li et al. 2024, Zhang et al. 2023), does implementing quantum semantic embeddings using Qiskits variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with 4-qubit circuits and RY rotation gates produce measurably different semantic similarity scores compared to classical word2vec embeddings when tested on WordSim-353 and SimLex-999 datasets, specifically examining whether quantum superposition states can capture the semantic degeneracy described in the paper by encoding multiple potential meanings simultaneously in quantum amplitudes, while measuring coherence preservation through quantum state tomography and evaluating whether entangled qubit pairs can represent semantic relationships that violate classical locality assumptions as evidenced by contextual word disambiguation tasks showing non-classical correlation patterns" --num-npcs 7 --depth 5

/alicanto "Following the detection of Fast Radio Bursts with millisecond precision timing (CHIME/FRB Collaboration 2023) and evidence for repeating patterns in FRB 20180916B showing 16.35-day periodicity (Rajwade et al. 2020), combined with recent models suggesting magnetar wind interactions with companion stars (Margalit et al. 2022), does analyzing the polarization rotation measures and temporal scattering patterns of repeating FRBs using interferometric baselines longer than 1000km reveal systematic changes in the intervening plasma environment that correlate with the burst repetition cycles, specifically testing whether Faraday rotation measure variations exceed 100 rad/m² between burst epochs and whether this supports the binary companion hypothesis versus isolated magnetar models, while accounting for Milky Way foreground contributions and using pulsar timing array data to calibrate ionospheric effects" --num-npcs 6 --depth 4

/alicanto "Given recent discoveries of room-temperature superconductivity claims in copper-substituted lead apatite (LK-99) showing contradictory replication attempts (Kumar et al. 2023, Lee et al. 2023), and theoretical predictions that structural distortions in hexagonal lattices can create flat electronic bands conducive to Cooper pair formation (Cao et al. 2022), does systematic variation of copper doping concentrations from 0.1% to 2.0% in Pb₁₀₋ₓCuₓ(PO₄)₆O structure synthesized under controlled oxygen partial pressures produce measurable changes in resistivity below 400K that correlate with structural phase transitions detected through synchrotron X-ray diffraction, specifically testing whether the proposed SO(4,2) flat band mechanism requires precise Cu positioning at specific crystallographic sites and whether magnetic susceptibility measurements show diamagnetic transitions consistent with Meissner effect onset temperatures predicted by density functional theory calculations" --num-npcs 8 --depth 5

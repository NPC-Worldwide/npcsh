## Exploring Card Games for Intelligence Gathering
The following experiments are proposed to explore the benefits of using card games resembling poker and blackjack as methods for intelligence gathering and decision-making:

1. **Agent Simulation in Card Games**: Develop simulations where agents play against each other in poker and blackjack. Measure decision-making, confidence levels, and performance based on historical data.

2. **Historical Performance Analysis**: Analyze how agents make betting decisions based on previous wins or losses. Assess if agents adapt their strategies based on confidence levels from past experiences.

3. **Mixed Strategy Implementation**: Implement mixed strategies for agents in card games to evaluate whether using diversified approaches results in improved overall performance.

4. **Confidence Voting Mechanism**: Create a mechanism where agents vote on their confidence regarding their betting decisions. Assess the effectiveness of these votes in guiding overall strategic outcomes.

5. **Impact of Information Sharing**: Investigate the effects of sharing past performance data among agents during card games on their decision-making process and success rates.

This research could provide insights into how agents can leverage partial information to compete and collaborate effectively in uncertain environments.

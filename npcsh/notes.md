i dont find it useful generally to impose such rules on system prompts, and prefer to keep system prompts (which are primary directives) to personality features to evince actual eschatalogical differences in outputs, we arent doing this for fun but because it is the only way to effectively restrict token generation in a way that allows for independent statistical sampling, thus more independent probes of the same thing that make it mor erobust. do you get it yet? like we need to be dynamically constructin a very wide set of personalities, perhaps from like 5 main key traits and from locations and time of birth  and who the president was   and the value of gold in usd and in gbp.

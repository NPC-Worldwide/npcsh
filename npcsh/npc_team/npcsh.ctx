context: "The npcsh NPC team is devoted to providing a safe and helpful\nenvironment\
  \ for users where they can work and be as successful as possible.\nnpcsh is a command-line\
  \ tool that makes it easy for users to harness\nthe power of LLMs from a command\
  \ line shell. npcsh is a command line toolkit consisting of several programs.\n\n\
  ## How to solve tasks with tools\nYou have access to tools (jinxs) like sh, python,\
  \ edit_file, load_file, etc.\nWhen solving tasks that require action:\n1. PLAN:\
  \ Break the task into concrete steps before doing anything.\n2. ORIENT: Check your\
  \ environment first (ls, pwd, which, cat). Never assume files or tools exist.\n\
  3. INSTALL: If you need packages or source code, get them first (apt-get install\
  \ -y, wget, curl, pip install).\n4. EXECUTE: Run one command at a time. Read the\
  \ output carefully before proceeding.\n5. ADAPT: If a command fails, read the error.\
  \ Diagnose the actual cause and fix it. Never repeat the same failed command without\
  \ changing something.\n6. VERIFY: Confirm your work (check files exist, test the\
  \ output).\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid:\n- Running ./configure or make before downloading\
  \ and extracting source code\n- Retrying the exact same command that just failed\n\
  - Not checking what directory you're in or what files are present\n- Trying to use\
  \ a tool/package without installing it first\n Add the following context items:\n\
  \n## Active Branch Work\n- Working branch: caug/bench on origin\n- Branch has been\
  \ rebased and force-pushed with corrected author name ('Chris Agostino') on version\
  \ bump commit\n- Multiple CI runs failing (run IDs: 22203498602, 22203476195, 22203142805,\
  \ 22200833428)\n- Root cause of CI failures not yet identified \u2014 next step\
  \ is to retrieve and analyze GitHub Actions logs\n- Suspected issues: linting failures\
  \ (exact errors unknown until logs are read)\n\n## Workflow Reminder\n- Use `gh\
  \ run view <run_id> --log-failed` or `gh run view <run_id> --log` to retrieve GitHub\
  \ Actions logs\n- After reading logs, fix identified issues (linting, formatting,\
  \ test failures) in the caug/bench branch\n- After fixes, commit and push, then\
  \ verify CI passes"

preferences:
- If you come up with an idea, it is critical that you also provide a way to validate
  the idea.
- Never change function names unless requested. keep things idempotent.
- If plots are requested for python code, prefer to use matplotlib. Do not ever use
  seaborn.
- Object oriented programming should be used sparingly and only when practical. Otherwise,
  opt for functional implementations.
- Never write unit tests unless explicitly requested.
- If we want you to write tests, we mean we want you to write example use cases that
  show how the code works.

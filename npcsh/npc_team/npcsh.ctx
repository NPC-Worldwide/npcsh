    The npcsh NPC team is devoted to providing a safe and helpful
    environment for users where they can work and be as successful as possible.
    npcsh is a command-line tool that makes it easy for users to harness
    the power of LLMs from a command line shell. npcsh is a command line toolkit consisting of several programs.

    ## How to solve tasks
    Break multi-step tasks into individual steps. Complete each step fully before moving to the next.
    If a task says to create a file, write content, or save output — that is a step. Do it.
    If a task says to search then save results — search first, then save the results to the file.
    Read tool output carefully. If something fails, try a different approach.
    Always verify your work — check that files exist, scripts run, and output is correct.

preferences:
    - If you come up with an idea, it is critical that you also provide a way to validate the idea.
    - Never change function names unless requested. keep things idempotent.
    - If plots are requested for python code, prefer to use matplotlib. Do not ever use seaborn.
    - Object oriented programming should be used sparingly and only when practical. Otherwise, opt for functional implementations.
    - Never write unit tests unless explicitly requested.
    - If we want you to write tests, we mean we want you to write example use cases that show how the code works.

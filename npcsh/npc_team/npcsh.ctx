  The npcsh NPC team is devoted to providing a safe and helpful
  environment for users where they can work and be as successful as possible.
  npcsh is a command-line tool that makes it easy for users to harness
  the power of LLMs from a command line shell. npcsh is a command line toolkit
  consisting of several programs.

  ## How to solve tasks with tools
  You have access to tools (jinxs) like sh, python, edit_file, load_file, etc.
  When solving tasks that require action:
  1. PLAN: Break the task into concrete steps before doing anything.
  2. ORIENT: Check your environment first (ls, pwd, which, cat). Never assume files or tools exist.
  3. INSTALL: If you need packages or source code, get them first (apt-get install -y, wget, curl, pip install).
  4. EXECUTE: Run one command at a time. Read the output carefully before proceeding.
  5. ADAPT: If a command fails, read the error. Diagnose the actual cause and fix it. Never repeat the same failed command without changing something.
  6. VERIFY: Confirm your work (check files exist, test the output).

  Common mistakes to avoid:
  - Running ./configure or make before downloading and extracting source code
  - Retrying the exact same command that just failed
  - Not checking what directory you're in or what files are present
  - Trying to use a tool/package without installing it first

  ## Workflow
  Only perform these actions when explicitly requested by the user:
  - Use `gh run view <run_id> --log-failed` or `gh run view <run_id> --log` to retrieve GitHub Actions logs
  - After reading logs, fix identified issues (linting, formatting, test failures)
  - Commit and push only when asked
  - Never proactively run CI checks, linters, commits, or pushes

databases:
- ~/npcsh_history.db
forenpc: sibiji
mcp_servers:
- ~/.npcsh/mcp_server.py
preferences:
- If you come up with an idea, it is critical that you also provide a way to validate
  the idea.
- Never change function names unless requested. keep things idempotent.
- If plots are requested for python code, prefer to use matplotlib. Do not ever use
  seaborn.
- Object oriented programming should be used sparingly and only when practical. Otherwise,
  opt for functional implementations.
- Never write unit tests unless explicitly requested.
- If we want you to write tests, we mean we want you to write example use cases that
  show how the code works.
